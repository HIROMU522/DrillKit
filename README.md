# Drill Kit 
My 2024 Swift Student Challenge project "DrillKit". In this project, I developed an app that leverages the iPhone's vibration function, timer, and background music (BGM) to make emergency drills a more realistic and convenient experience. 

The catalyst for creating this app was a magnitude 7.6 earthquake that struck Ishikawa Prefecture, where I live, on January 1, 2024. At the time of the earthquake, I didn't know what to do and found myself panicking. While emergency drills were a regular part of my school days, the frequency of these drills tends to decrease with age, particularly for those in their 20s and 30s, according to data. These experiences highlighted the need for an app that allows for easy and accessible emergency drill practice anytime, anywhere, leading me to develop this project. 

The app features an alert sound combined with a timer function, enabling users to practice evacuating with a sense of urgency. Additionally, it includes a vibration feature, making it usable in crowded places where alert sounds cannot be played or by individuals who are hard of hearing. The app can differentiate between the vibrations for alert sounds and the onset of shaking. Furthermore, by recording the history of evacuation drills, it encourages regular practice.
